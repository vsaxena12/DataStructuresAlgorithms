## Sliding Windows

When to use: 

- Contiguous data: The input data is stored in a contiguous manner, such as an array or string. 
- Processing subsets of elements: The problem requires repeated computations on a contiguous subset of 
data elements (a subarray or a substring), such that the window moves across the input array from one end 
to the other. The size of the window may be fixed or variable, depending on the requirements of the problem.
- Efficient computation time complexity: The computations performed every time the window moves take 
constant or very small time.

Used in:
- Streaming
- Social Media etc.
