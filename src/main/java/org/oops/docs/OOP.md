# OOP

Object-oriented programming, also called OOP, is a programming model that is dependent on the concept of objects and classes.

Building blocks

- Attributes or fields (represents state of the object)
- Methods (represents behavior, having access to class attributes and other methods)
- Classes (blueprint for creating objects)
- Objects (having state and behavior)

## Priciple of OOP

- Encapsulation: binding data and methods together in a single unitâ€”class (private fields, Parameterized constructor, setters and getters)
- Abstraction: revealing the necessary details of a system and hiding irrelevant information to minimize its complexity
- Inheritance (Is-A relationship, Square is a Shape, extends existing class)
- Polymorphism (method override and overload)
