# Data Structures

What are Data Structures?

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They provide a means to manage large amounts of data for various applications such as databases, operating systems, and more.

Types of Data Structures

	1.	Linear Data Structures:
	•	Array: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
	•	Linked List: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node.
	•	Stack: A collection of elements with Last In, First Out (LIFO) access.
	•	Queue: A collection of elements with First In, First Out (FIFO) access.
	2.	Non-linear Data Structures:
	•	Tree: A hierarchical structure with nodes connected by edges, such as binary trees, AVL trees, and B-trees.
	•	Graph: A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, used to represent networks.
	3.	Hash-based Data Structures:
	•	Hash Table: A structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.
	•	HashSet: A collection of unique elements implemented using a hash table.
	4.	Specialized Data Structures:
	•	Heap: A special tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property.
	•	Trie: A tree-like structure used to store dynamic sets of strings.

# Algorithms

What are Algorithms?

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are used for data processing, calculations, and automated reasoning tasks. Algorithms are essential for efficient data manipulation and retrieval in data structures.

Types of Algorithms

	1.	Searching Algorithms:
    	•	Linear Search: Sequentially checks each element of the list until the desired element is found.
	    •	Binary Search: Searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
	2.	Sorting Algorithms:
	    •	Bubble Sort: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
	    •	Selection Sort: Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist.
	    •	Merge Sort: Divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them.
	    •	Quick Sort: Picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
	3.	Dynamic Programming Algorithms:
	    •	Fibonacci Sequence: Computes the nth Fibonacci number using memoization to store previously computed values.
	    •	Knapsack Problem: Solves optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.
	4.	Graph Algorithms:
	    •	Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
	    •	A Search Algorithm*: Finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node.
	    •	Kruskal’s Algorithm: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
	5.	Divide and Conquer Algorithms:
	    •	Merge Sort: Divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them.
	    •	Quick Sort: Selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot.
	6.	Greedy Algorithms:
	    •	Fractional Knapsack Problem: Chooses the best option at each step to find an optimal solution.
	    •	Prim’s Algorithm: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph by selecting the smallest edge at each step.
	7.	Backtracking Algorithms:
	    •	N-Queens Problem: Places N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
	    •	Sudoku Solver: Solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking.

How Data Structures and Algorithms Work Together

Data structures and algorithms are interdependent. The choice of data structure affects the efficiency of algorithms, and vice versa. For example:

	•	Searching: Binary search requires a sorted array.
	•	Sorting: Quick sort and merge sort algorithms use arrays or lists.
	•	Graph Traversal: Breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) use graphs.

Key Concepts

	1.	Time Complexity: Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input.
	2.	Space Complexity: Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input.
	3.	Big O Notation: Describes the upper bound of the time complexity in the worst-case scenario, such as O(n), O(log n), O(n^2).
