## Dynamic Programming (DP)

- Core Idea:
    - Solve problems by breaking them into overlapping sub-problems.
    - Store the results of already-solved sub-problems (memoization or tabulation) to avoid redundant calculations.
- Relation to Recursion:
    - Recursive DP uses recursion to solve sub-problems and memoization to store results.
    - Iterative DP (tabulation) avoids recursion by solving sub-problems iteratively in a bottom-up manner.
- Feature:
    - Overlapping sub-problems that can be reused.
