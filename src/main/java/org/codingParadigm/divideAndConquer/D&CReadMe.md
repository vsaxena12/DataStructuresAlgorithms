## Divide and Conquer (D&C)

- Core Idea:
    - Divide the problem into smaller, independent sub-problems.
    - Solve each sub-problem recursively.
    - Combine the results of the sub-problems to solve the overall problem.
- Relation to Recursion:
    - D&C heavily relies on recursion to break down problems into smaller parts.
    - Example: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.
- Key Feature:
    - The sub-problems do not overlap; each is solved independently.
