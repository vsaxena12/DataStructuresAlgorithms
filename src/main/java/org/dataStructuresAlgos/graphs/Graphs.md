# Graphs

## Terminologies
E: Edges (Link between the objects)
V: Nodes or Vertices (Objects)

We thus represent an edge e in E as a two element subset of V: e = {u,v}
where, u and v are the nodes and e is the edge between them. 

### Definitions:
1. Directed edge
2. Undirected edge
3. Directed graph
4. Undirected graph
5. Adjacent vertices: edge connecting two vertices
6. Graph with no cycle: Tree
7. Edge that connects a vertex to itself: Self Loop
8. Two edges are parallel if they connect the same pair of vertices
9. Degree of vertex is the number of edges incident on it.

1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List
3. Adjacency Set
