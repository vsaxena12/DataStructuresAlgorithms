# Grokking The Coding Patterns

## Two Sum
- Involves maintaining two pointers that traverse the data structure in a coordinated manner, typically starting from different positions or moving in opposite directions.

Does your problem match this pattern?

Yes, if: 

- Linear data structure: The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.

- Process pairs: Process data elements at two different positions simultaneously.

- Dynamic pointer movement: Both pointers move independently of each other according to certain conditions or criteria. In addition, both pointers might move along the same or two different data structures.
