# AVL

1. AVL is a self balancing BST
2. |Height of each left subtree - Height of each right subtree| = 1

## Conditions for AVL Trees
1. LL Condition - Right rotation
2. LR Condition
3. RL Condition
4. RR Condition

This is needed for Insertion and Deletion to balance the BST. 

When BST is balanced, searching and traversing takes O(log n) time complexity.
